Yes, another Discord Bot, but this time one can yt play songs!

If for some reason you want to run it in your local environment, you'll need to follow some steps:
- clone this repository
- `npm install` in the project folder
- rename the `config-example.json` to `config.json` and fill the object values to their correct ones.
- Finally, `npm run dev` to start the bot; you're good to go!
